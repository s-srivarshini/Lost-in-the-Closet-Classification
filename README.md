# Lost in the Closet - Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify clothing items. Inspired by an artist's quest to categorize various pieces of clothing, this project leverages the Fashion MNIST dataset to distinguish among different fashion products.

## Installation
To run the notebook and replicate the findings, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install torchvision
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```
## Structure
Here's what you'll find in this repository:

```bash
/Lost_in_the_Closet-Classification.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook with model training and evaluation
/outputs                    # Contains model artifacts, accuracy, and loss plots
```

## Features
This project includes:

* A custom CNN architecture.
* Training and validation scripts.
* Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics.
* Visualizations of training progress.

## Experiments and Results
I experimented with various hyperparameters, activation functions, and dropout rates to optimize the model's performance. The results indicate the trade-offs between speed and stability during training.
